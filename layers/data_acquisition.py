Data Acquisition Layer
=======================
Layer 1 of the HB-BIS system

This layer handles:
- Loading images from files (scanner/camera sources)
- Validating image format and quality
- Encrypting images for secure storage
- Decrypting images for processing

Educational Focus:
    This layer demonstrates the first step in any biometric system: acquiring
    the raw biometric sample (handwriting image) and ensuring it meets quality
    standards before further processing.

        behavior during matching.
