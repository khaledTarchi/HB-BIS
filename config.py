*** EDUCATIONAL PROTOTYPE ONLY ***

This system is designed for learning and demonstration purposes.
It is NOT suitable for real security applications.

Key limitations:
* Simplified encryption (XOR) provides no real security
* Small-scale database (not optimized for thousands of users)
* No liveness detection (vulnerable to photo attacks)
* Thresholds are not professionally calibrated

Use this system to understand biometric concepts, not for actual authentication.
"""

ENCRYPTION_WARNING = """
This system uses XOR encryption with a fixed key for educational purposes.
This provides NO real security - it only demonstrates the concept.

In production systems, use:
• AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
• RSA-2048+ or ECDSA for asymmetric encryption
• Proper key derivation (PBKDF2, Argon2)
• Secure key storage (HSM, TPM, or encrypted keychain)
"""

MODEL_COMPARISON_INFO = """
SVM vs SqueezeNet - Understanding the Difference:

SVM (Classical Approach):
• Uses 42 handcrafted features (ink density, strokes, curvature, etc.)
• Features are interpretable - we know what each dimension means
• Fast feature extraction (~20-30ms)
• Works well with small datasets
• Requires domain expertise to design features

SqueezeNet (Deep Learning Approach):
• Uses 512-dimensional learned representation
• Features are NOT interpretable - learned automatically
• Slower feature extraction (~50-100ms on CPU)
• Generally more powerful with sufficient data
• Can fine-tune with triplet loss for better discrimination
• No feature engineering needed

Both approaches are valid and teach different aspects of biometric systems!
